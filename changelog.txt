    - Added API `things.remove_transient_child`
    - Added API `things.get_transient_child`
    - Added API `things.get_transient_children`

    - Implemented `things.ThingRegistration.migrate_tags_callback` which allows migration of entities that already have stored blueprint tags into Things.
    - Implemented `things.ThingRegistration.initial_tags_callback` which allows setting initial tags on Things with intercepted construction.
