---A `Thing` is the extended lifecycle of a collection of game entities that
---actually represent the same ultimate thing. For example, a thing could
---be constructed from a blueprint (entity #1: ghost), built by a bot (entity #2: real),
---killed by a biter and replaced by a ghost (entity #3: ghost),
---rebuilt by a player (entity #4: real), mined by a player (virtual entity
---in an undo buffer), then rebuilt by an undo command. (entity #5). All of
---these entities are different LuaEntity objects, but they all represent
---the same ultimate `Thing`.
