duplicate-ghost-warning=Warning: Duplicate ghost detected at world key '__1__'. This ghost is already mapped to (__2__,__3__), but something is remapping it to (__4__,__5__). This indicates a bug in one of the two mods that created these ghosts, or a bug in Things itself. Please report this to the mod authors.
